# Elastic Stack-Based SIEM for Log Analysis and Threat Detection

## Objective

This project began as a hands-on way to better understand how SIEMs work in real-world environments. My goal was to set up the Elastic Stack as a SIEM, collect logs and metrics from a Kali Linux VM, and configure email alerts for potential threats. Through this process, I aimed to deepen my cybersecurity knowledge and build practical skills I can apply in real-world scenarios.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the Elastic Stack for log ingestion, correlation, and analysis.
- Telemetry shippers (Filebeat and Metricbeat) for collecting system logs and performance metrics from Kali Linux.
- Virtualized Kali Linux environment for generating realistic system activity and security events.
- Alerting frameworks (Kibana Alerting and Elastalert) for real-time threat detection and email notifications.
- Mail transfer agent (Postfix/SMTP) for sending automated alerts based on detection rules.
- Virtualization platform (VirtualBox/VMware) to simulate a controlled test environment.
- Linux command-line utilities for configuration, monitoring, and log validation.
